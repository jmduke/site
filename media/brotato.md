Fitting to have picked this up a year or so after [[Vampire Survivor]], a better game in almost all respects
but one that is also a bit more difficult to get into. Brotato is a game that is very easy to get into, but _lacks_
a lot of what elevated Vampire Survivor beyond just "a perfect Skinner box" to me — the sense of exploration and mystique,
the metagame aspects, the bizarre and satisfying visual design. Brotato feels very much like a $4.99 game you find on the
iOS app store and are pleasantly surprised by.

(All of this sounds cruel, but let me be clear: it's a very fun game, and even after having 'finished' it — having
gotten all I think I'm going to get out of it — I'm sure I'll play it for another dozen hours at least.)

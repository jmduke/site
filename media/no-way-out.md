Terrific thriller in the vein of [[The Conversation]] and [[Klute]] (albeit with a more political bent.) What elevated
this from good to great for me was the excellent bit-role performances: the loyal-to-a-fault aide and the dead whore can be
boring, flat parts but the actors did _excellent_ work. (And of course noteworthy: this is probably the first thing I've seen
Kevin Costner in that I liked, and the twist ending is unnecessary but delightful.)

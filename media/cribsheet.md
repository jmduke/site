A follow-up to [[Expecting Better]] focusing on the first few years of parenthood and what some combination of data, studies, and rational rigor tells us about common crossroads (breastfeeding vs. formula, daycare vs. nanny, television vs. no television, et cetera.)

I found this a less _compelling_ read than its predecessor through no fault of Oster — I think there's a little less concrete to say or take away from the corpus of scientific literature at hand, and this mostly served to re-inforce a few of our existing thoughts and heuristics for when we have kids as opposed to completely re-shaping our framing of parenthood.

More than anything, I think the take-away I had from this book was a simple but useful one: everything is an opportunity cost. There's very little _inherent_ merit or demerit in a lot of choices one makes, and the real analyses have to be made within the context of the maelstorm — and the maelstrom is different for every family.

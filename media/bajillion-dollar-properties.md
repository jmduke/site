I think exactly one season of this was enough to peg it as a UCB/Comedy Bang-Bang jobs program, and while I don't mean that _exactly_ as damning it with faint praise it's not exactly mining the depths for fresh material; [[Burning Love]] felt/feels like a more obviously successful take on the same end goal.

(Having said that, I could certainly see myself picking the latter seasons up at some point — but in much the same manner I might reach for bad takeout, out of convenience rather than palate.)

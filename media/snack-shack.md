A really fun and pleasant movie that was never surprising and extremely fun, start-to-finish. This is a by-the-numbers bildungsroman — two teens, a cool girl next door, a deified older friend, hijinks — and you know exactly what plot points are going to get and they are delivered capably. The script is modern in a way that betrays its theoretical nineties setting (with apologies to the director, Adam Carter Rehmeier, but unless you were _really_ ahead of your time I don't think the [[Juno]]-esque bon mots were really that autobiographical!) but is sold _so_ convincingly and brightly by the pair of leads that you don't mind at all.

Does this movie have revelation? I'm not sure about that. Conor Sherry's performance — and his visceral sense of alienation — has a whiff of the sweet, relatable angst that I loved so much about [[The Secret History]] and even the first few bits of [[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]. Much of the center does not hold: Mika Abdalla's character is a little too vacuous and the final few beats are just _so_ neatly wrapped that it's hard to really come away from the movie feeling like it's anything better than a more modern Sandlot (which is not that bad of a final analysis, to be clear!)

(More than anything, this movie reminded me of why I loved [[Everybody Wants Some!!]] so much: Linklater created a world that was warm and sweet and anodyne and had you exit that world in a way that felt _novel_.)

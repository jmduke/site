Very sympathetic to the core theses of capital management advanced by the author, but I do not feel like I garnered much insight that hasn't already been absorbed by the zeitgeist. It was a mercifully short book, but most of it was in the uncanny valley of not _quite_ specific enough to be useful. I thought [[lessons-from-the-titans]] was a strictly better and more interesting read; more unconventional insights, more pragmatic details, more interesting prose.

**Quotes**

- \_A bartender at one of the management retreats made a handsome return by buying Capital Cities stock in the 1970s. \_When an executive later asked why he had made the investment, the bartender replied, “I’ve worked at a lot of corporate events over the years, but Capital Cities was the only company where you couldn’t tell who the bosses were.”
- Leadership is analysis.

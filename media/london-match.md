A satisfying but non-revelatory ending to the trilogy started by [[Berlin Game]] and [[Mexico Set]], whose lack of true satisfaction in its ending both feels _earned_ (in the sense that one of the main messages of these books has been the _lack_ of clean breaks and endings in the conflicts and characters it catalogues) and _pending_ (there are six more books in the series, and while I haven't looked to see if Deighton explicitly crafted the second trilogy after having once considered the original trilogy "done" you could definitely take it either way.)

I wrote in **Mexico Set** about how these books felt a little like Christie novels, and while that's true here there was also something of the workplace sit-com in them, in the familiarity you osmose in book after book with the same cast of folks. While it feels like there's no small amount of contrivance at hand (you grow to imagine MI6 as a huge, empty building populated with only our five or six named deuteragonists), it's also _nice_ to see the growth and warmth imbued in otherwise tossed-off caricatures like Tessa & George.

I think I'll take a (long) break before resuming the nonalogy of these books, but I'm happy to have blitzed through the first three: they were both gripping and rewarding, and Bernard Samson makes for a delight.

Moments of the final season were _exciting_ and _cool_: the timeskip had interesting moments, the budget was well-spent on some terrific action sequences, the production quality was overall high.

But the entire _thing_ was incoherent, an incoherence which existed back in its [first season](https://jmduke.com/media/attack-on-titan-season-1-/) but has only grown over time and with stakes. Characterization is minimized in favor of "how do we get people to move this plot forward in the most surpising way"; power levels are absolutely random in a way that makes it hard to empathize or invest in any single conflict since the answer to "who wins?" is "whatever services the arc most conveniently"; every single character is shrouded in plot armor.

The closest thing I think the show has to a coherent thesis is this: **the cycle of war is interminable, and horrific, and corrupts everything and everyone it touches. But despite that, life is worth living and peace is a cause worth fighting for.** There are points in this season of television that portray that subtly and gracefully; there are points where I am not quite sure that the show even believes that message.

All of this is to say: Attack on Titan certainly lacked the enduring warmth and charm of [[Mob Psycho 100]], and it has less trenchant and cogent things to say about war and the human condition than [[Vinland Saga]]. I am glad to have finished it, and do not think it was very good.

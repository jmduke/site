Of the games whose _gameplay_ I truly love, my overall sentiment towards them scales based on their level of ludonarrative assonance: how well does the story fit the gameplay, and how much am I enjoying the _narrative experience_ of the game versus just the tactile experience of playing it?

- there are the games whose story actively detract from the otherwise wonderful gameplay ([[Final Fantasy X-2]], [[Diablo III]]);
- the ones whose narrative is absent, so it neither adds nor substracts from the overall experience ([[Crystal Project]], [[Monster Sanctuary]]);
- the ones whose narrative _improves_ the game ([[Ori and the Blind Forest]], [[Hades]]).

And then the rarified air arrives, and you find games that not only combine narrative and gameplay in a really cohesive, intuitive way but manage to do so in a way that make you think something along the lines of: "this experience I am having — this level of frustration and joy and despair and triumph — could not happen without the medium through which I'm experiencing it."

That's what Celeste is. The gameplay is perfectly crafted not just as a delightful puzzle box or dexterity concert but _as a vehicle to tell a story and teach you something about yourself_.

There's nothing that I think could be improved about Celeste; it is one of the most meaningful and memorable artistic experiences of my life.

- Magnuson Park on a lazy Saturday in July;
- Golden Gardens on a rare sunny October day;
- Top Pot (for nostalgia's sake);
- Gasworks;
- Taste of India;
- Unicorn (and living across the street from it for two years);
- the Vivace sidewalk stand (where I made my first Seattle friend, hi Shep);
- Zig Zag;
- coffee-walks around Green Lake;
- Freeway Park;
- the bar at Canlis;
- the twice-baked almond croissant at Bakery Nouveau;
- the live performance of the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack at the Cornish Playhouse;
- Damn the Weather (and their Caesar Salad sandwich);
- long, lovely, lazy walks/runs/rides around the Burke-Gilman;
- the omni-present haze of pot and laughter at Cal Anderson;
- Twice Sold Tales and Ada's;
- 5 Point, where I had my first legal beer;
- the University farmer's market;
- the Arboretum;
- Knee High, Inside Passage, and Canon (on industry nights);
- Herkimer;
- SBP (before it got overrun by all the UW kids);
- Schilling, Paseo, Dick's;
- any and every possible sporting event.

I lived in Seattle for ten years; I left because it was time to leave; every time I come back I think about staying. Seattle forever.

Canned cocktails, despite the inherit oxymoron, are on the rise. I have friends ask me which ones they should get, if any â€” I also have friends and family give me a good amount.

In general: they are all bad. There are exactly _two_ exceptions: [Tiptop Cocktails](https://tiptopcocktails.com/) and [Straightaway Cocktails](https://straightawaycocktails.com/collections/shop-all). Both of these are delicious, well-packaged, and a gift that a cocktail-lover will probably not _hate_. (They are not as good as "the real thing", but they pass the bar of "can be drunk by someone who likes cocktails without that person having a conniption", which is more than can be said of Via Carota et al.)

If you really want to get a cocktail-themed gift, though, I'd recommend stuff in the following genres:

- An amaro. Nobody has enough amari, they last forever, and they look nice on a bar.
- Dasher bottles. (Or interesting glassware in general. Avoid bar "equipment", with the exception of dasher bottles because they're small.)
- Bitters.

- `.njk` as the default templating language is an odd choice, and I find myself stubbing my toe on it a good amount. Maybe that's a me thing!
- It is _extremely_ fast. This site has around 2300 pages; Eleventy is compiling it in around two seconds.
- The extensibility ergonomics are terrific. This is all it takes to declare a new filter, for instance:

```js
eleventyConfig.addFilter("toStars", (rating) => {
  return "â˜…".repeat((rating + 1) / 2);
});
```

- I can keep the Markdown content relatively pure, which (after poor and brief dalliances with `.mdx` et al) is now Very Important to me.

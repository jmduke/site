In [late 2022](https://x.com/jmduke/status/1568620789057847297) I had designs on starting a new little tool, pulling out some useful but gnarly code out of Buttondown for rendering tweets (and other such similar media) and productizing it. It was called **Bedkit**, and [the splash page is still live for the next few days](https://bedkit.app/).

In a rare display of realism and humility, I am letting the domain name pass. Bedkit — still a good idea, in the abstract! — never came to pass. A couple reasons why:

1. Late '22 was when Twitter announced their API pricing changes, which would have immediately disqualified the business from using tweets as the first tranche of content;
2. I got distracted.

These things happen; I am not filled with much regret. The prospect of building a second thing seems even more daunting than it did back then — [building free tools as marketing](https://shovel.report) seems more approachable. Still, RIP Bedkit — I wish someone else had built you, so I could get rid of a lot of my own code.

Hackworth was a forger, Dr. X was a honer. The distinction was at
least as old as the digital computer. Forgers created a new technology and
then forged on to the next project, having explored only the outlines of its
potential. Honers got less respect because they appeared to sit still
technologically, playing around with systems that were no longer start,
hacking them for all they were worth, getting them to do things the forgers
had never envisioned.

really a test of his expertise. I still had no measure of him and couldn't guess what his
motives might be. As it was, he walked right into it. That is to say, he walked right into

impulsive actions. That was how Hannibal won the Battle of Lake Trasimene after
crossing the Apennines. All it needed was that sudden dash towards Rome to make
Flaminius chase after him and blunder right into his ambush. Hannibal would probably
have had the makings of a good field agent.

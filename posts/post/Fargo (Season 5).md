There are things I didn't like; almost all of them were outweighed, in retrospect, by the absolute battleaxe performances of Juno Temple and Sam Spruell, culminating in one of the sweetest and most revelatory sequences in television (probably my absolute favorite moment since [[Andor (Season 1)]]) between the two. That final sequence of scenes is **brave**, not just in its decidedly Midwestern depiction of communion (who needs bread & wine when you have a Yuengling and Bisquik drop biscuits?) but in its repudiation of true irredeemable evil (a concept which Noah Hawley has trafficked in to great effect for the majority of his career!)

I sincerely hope this is final season; I can't think of a much better note to end things on.

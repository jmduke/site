A pretty tremendous series of television, whose economy in storytelling, propulsion in narrative, and sheer production value leaves little to be desired. It's hard to really nail the six-episode series _with_ a nice breadcrumb trail to the sequel and they absolutely did it. Cannot think of a single complaint, and the only reason it's not rated higher is that there's little emotional resonance: this is one of the finest seasons of television I've ever watched, and I will recommend it heartily, but I can't quite say that it changed my life.

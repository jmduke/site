description: In which I chat about blogging, the internet's footprint, and why to write.

There are few pleasures greater than getting to be profiled for an interview series that you've been reading for months, and last week I got to do exactly that.

To browse Manu's site — not just this interview series — feels a bit like walking on a quiet beach in autumn: there's a sense of peace and timelessness that is hard to find in the hustle and bustle of the increasingly-cacophonous internet. Fittingly, the interview is centered on the _why_ and _how_ of blogging:

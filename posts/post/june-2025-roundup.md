Summer's here and the ink flows slower than the sweat (we lost A/C for a few days, the misery of which was counterweighed by me correctly diagnosing the problem as a busted capacitor). So much still in the drafts folder: NotePlan, Nixonland, Husbands and Wives, Let Them All Talk, Hex, The Score Takes Care of Itself, The War Room, The Straight Story, Clerks. We'll be travelling (Seattle, then Reno); we'll be keeping busy.

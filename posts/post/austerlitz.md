I can count on one hand the number of books I've read in the past decade that immediately overwhelmed me with how obviously and singularly _great_ they were, not just in deployment of prose and style or in narrative structure or in content and message but how all of these things swirled together in a perfect cocktail, each informing and enhancing the other — indeed, this sort of gestalt analysis of a piece of art seems more obvious to me in the context of video games (see my writing on [[Celeste]]), where it's easier for me to separate the act of "playing the game" from the act of "internalizing/critiquing the game."

But Austerlitz, like [[Pale Fire]] or [[To the Lighthouse]] (to call out two examples that come most readily to mind), as a perfect gem — unique, brilliant prose supporting a terrific and (to flirt with redundancy) unique post-modernistic struture, neither of which are rococo but in fact are deployed _specifically_ to tell the story that Sebald wishes to tell.

A jewel of a book; everyone should experience it.

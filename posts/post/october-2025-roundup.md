How are you doing? Are you doing well?

October's been very fun, as evinced by the length of things I am remiss in writing about: EntryThingy 2.0, Long Live The Post Horn, Spy Game, Poor Things, DuckDB, The War Room, The Straight Story, TypeID, Florida, Hex, Stainless, and more. The days are long; the nights are peaceful; Lucy is obsessed with brioche; Telly got a partial ACL tear and remembers to hobble around on three legs instead of four if my parents are over since they're liable to fall for it; my Schwinn got a tune-up; I wore my Albert slippers for the first time.

Life accelerates; this year is a bullet train. I am free to wander from car to car but nothing changes our speed of one hundred and eighty miles per hour. This month lasted approximately three days; I would not trade those three days for anything in the world.

Once upon a time, I wrote weeknotes for Buttondown. I’ve started them up again—the first edition is linked below. I’ll spare you the navel-gazing about whether they belong there or on the blog (I cover that in the other post). In short: this won’t really affect the blog. Most of what will go into weeknotes are things I’ve been too much of a coward to blog about until now. So, consider this just more content for your enjoyment.

Two quick programming notes:

1. The subscriber lists for the blog and weeknotes will remain separate. I’ll make sure to occasionally nudge folks from one list to the other, and might even use this as a chance to dogfood some cross-promotional features—like, how do you send a CTA only to people not already subscribed to a given list? Still, it’s important (for my brain and heart) that these stay truly independent publications, as grandiose as that sounds. I want to keep firing off takes about ’70s cinema without worrying about The Brand, and vice versa.

2. As for this site: I’d like to cross-publish weeknotes here, but right now that’s basically impossible. So, I’ll probably use this as an excuse to rejigger the design into something a bit more microbloggy. I’m [especially inspired by Gina's newly launched “note to self,”](https://notetoself.studio/) which nails the vibe I’m after: a mix of short, link-blogging-style posts and longer standalone pieces.

In descending order of importance:

- I had [a daughter, Lucy, the light of my life](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/lucy/).
- I launched a tiny side project, [handbook.directory](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/handbook/).
- I cautioned against [equivocating profile with praxis](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/profile-is-not-praxis/) and [overreacting to vendor outages](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/vendor-outages/).
- I [jotted down some notes on Bluesky, and post-Twitter social media writ large](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/bluesky/).
- I suggested [always using an enum instead of a boolean](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/enums/) and [keeping your marketing site separate](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/marketing-site/).
- I read and opined on [Creation Lake](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/creation-lake/), [High Output Management](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/high-output-management/), and [Cable Cowboy](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/cable-cowboy/).

I hope you are well; I, for one, am bleary-eyed and blessed.

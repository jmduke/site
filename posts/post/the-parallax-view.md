I admired and liked [[Klute]] but did not quite love it as much as I loved [[The Conversation]], which I thought tackled the coming battleground of large-scale surveillance and visibility and the small-scale world of human minutiae with more aesthetic aplomb and coherent theses.

Most of my pico-criticisms are answered in Bakula's spiritual successor to Klute, **The Parallax View**. Absolutely dynamite performance by Beatty, two of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the past few years for me (the film-within-the-film, and the long slow shot of Hammond's corpse being driven, via golf cart, into an increasingly large number of chairs in the now-empty auditorium.)

I'm sure many comparisons can and will be drawn between this and [[Three Days of the Condor]], but that film chooses to at least offer the viewer a _glimmer_ of hope: that a sufficiently disciplined and idealistic protagonist can make a difference in the world. Bakula offers no hope here, and the sheer paranoia and cynicism of this film (very few questions answered; very few fears dispelled) makes me feel like it is a perfect movie for these times, when we are once again terrified of the world around us and the people who drive it.

A very solid little thriller that does not reach the heights Bakula did with [[The Parallax View]], but was still a very successful example (and, in some places, inversion) of the form. Harrison Ford playing against type as a skeevy prosecutor; a proto-[[West Wing]] ensemble with a very spry-looking John Spencer and Bradley Whitford; a fun, twisty-but-not-too-twisty ending (which is a great victory for Poirot Media Literacy â€” if you watch the show like a murder mystery, you'll notice the loose threads!); smarmy, oily performances by Brian Dennehy and Raul Julia; there's not a lot to _love_ (I do not think this movie will change your relationship with the world in a meaningful way), but there's a lot to like.

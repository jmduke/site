A really fun game and truly impressive indie effort that suffers from many of the same flaws (albeit less so) as
[[Dicey Dungeons]] — a slow early-game, a sense of disempowering non-determinism, a lack of depth. I bet I play this
a dozen (or a dozen dozen!) more times, because there's still so much going for it — runs tend to be quick, there's a lot of fun combinatorics at play, and it feels very easy to pick up. (And the aesthetics + presentation are terrific.) I'm just being a harsh judge because [[Slay the Spire]] set the bar so very, very high.

Still tremendously entertaining, though the back half felt a little [[mandalorian]]-y with how absurd the action sequences were in a way that undermined the grimy, "realistic" emphasis the show tries to place otherwise. Will be very excited for the upcoming season, but nothing has quite hit the same high as that first tremendous season.

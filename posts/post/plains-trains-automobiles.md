> You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me; I'm not changing. I like... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.

There are a few movies that I consider part of a "TBS canon", in that I've seen _commercials_ for them for an aggregate of _years_ and have a vague sense of what they're about but have never actually _seen_. This is one of them, and while nothing in _Planes, Trains and Automobiles_ is revelatory or _novel_, it hits the John Hughes notes perfectly.

I am simply not a buddy comedy guy, nor much of a road trip movie guy, and much of the actual plotting felt so lukewarm that I couldn't even endear myself to the faux suspense of it all. But Martin and Candy's performances are pitch-perfect; even without the telegraphed reveal or the saccharine reunion, the graduation evolution of the two characters from charming pastiche into rounded, wounded realism is timeless.

Absolutely _entranced_ for the first two acts, and then the wheels start to come off a bit, and then you realize that if you think too hard about _any_ piece of it the entire thing crumbles into dust. (A charitable interpretation of this is that the movie is a parable of movie-making itself, of the necessity of suspension of disbelief.) Still, there is a lot to love: Michael Douglass in a role that I felt _truly_ suited his talents and interests, a terrific score, Fincher's impressionistic use of night and rain.

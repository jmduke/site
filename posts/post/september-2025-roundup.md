The last of summer's grip finally loosened its hold this September, and Richmond began its annual transformation into something gentler and more contemplative. This morning's walk with Telly required a dusting-off of the closet-buried Patagonia puffer jacket; it's perfect for walks with Lucy, who has graduated into the Big Kid stroller making it easier than ever for her to point at every dog ("dah!"), every bird (also "dah!"), every passing leaf that dared to flutter in her line of sight. 

As you will read below, the big corporate milestone for me in August was sponsoring Djangocon and having our first offsite over the course of a single week. Sadly, our Seattle trip was once again canceled. Haley and Lucy both got a little sick, and we had to abandon course. It's weird to think this will be the first year since 2011 that we have not stepped foot in the Pacific Northwest. 

More than anything though, I learned this month for the first time how impossibly difficult it is to be away from your daughter for six days. It is something I hope I have to go through again for a very long time.

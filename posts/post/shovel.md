Lucy is now at the age where there's some level of predictability and structure in the evenings. She goes to bed around 7, and I generally have around three hours where I need to head upstairs myself. Most of this time is spent away from rectangles: cleaning up the kitchen, getting back into a barbell program, walking the dog, and so on.

But in the precious little time that remains, when I don't have anything Buttondown-shaped that demands my attention, I have been refurbishing [Shovel](https://shovel.report) to bring it to some sort of 1.0, out of its perpetual half-assed alpha. Part of this work has been deciding on a name. I really love Shovel: it's fun because the tool itself is a faster and more ergonomic way to `dig`. It combines both a certain physicality and sonorous bent; it feels good to say the word "shovel", as if parsing DNS records is not so far away conceptually from digging ditches.

But Shovel as a name has a big problem, which is that it's a violation of my core belief at this point that the name does not matter and what matters is having a dot com. [Shovel.com](https://shovel.com) is for sale, by the way, and some early entreaties to the current owner reveal an asking price in, and I quote, "mid to high seven figures." So that was out, and thus began a long and protracted discovery process in finding a replacement name.

It is shockingly difficult to come up with a name based on the following constraints: 

1. The dot com is available.
2. There is no obvious competition from other proper nouns or brands.
3. It doesn't sound like absolute shit, which I note is a different threshold than "I like it".

This, in my mind, is a meager list, and yet I spent two months trying and failing to find domains that satisfied it.

The two biggest frontrunners were [Foxlight](https://foxlight.com), which had mysteriously been registered between my coming up with the idea and my trying to purchase it. And [Pingfisher](https://pingfisher.com), which is in and of itself a fun refernce to one of my previous projects, but failed the test of "do I feel embarrassed when I say this out loud?" And if I'm going to have to break one rule with this name, then I ultimately decided that I break the first. Shovel.report is now... shovel.sh.

Not exactly a premium TLD, and I'm sure right after publishing this, I'll end up grabbing `shovelhq.com` or use `useshovel.com`, some anodyne TLD just to cover my bases. Again, I cannot emphasize enough how little emotional investment I put into finding this domain, and yet it _still_ was that difficult. (The comedy option I was seriously considering, by the way, was just going full retrograde with it and registering as the Virginia Milling Company, a trademark which surprisingly does not yet exist.)

Earlier this week, I stumbled upon this brilliant [marketing-slash-documentation idea from SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/spaces/restore-database-from-aws-s-3/) â€” notebooks as a first-party page! There are a handful of nice things about this idea:

- Very easy to fan out. You're not going to really run out of sample notebooks from which you can create pages.
- Easy to share and 'productize'.
- Lends itself obviously to both onboarding and existing users ("try it now" for people who aren't signed in, "use my API key" for people who are.)
- Doesn't require narrative or cohesion in the same way the same content as a blog post does.

I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't become much more popular across developer tools businesses in the next few years.

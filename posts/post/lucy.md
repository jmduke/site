Lucy Frances Duke was born this week: on September 23, 2024. She came a few weeks early: a purported due date of October 13 was moved up a few weeks due to Haley having high blood pressure (asymptomatic, but slightly elevated nonetheless), but she came in at just over seven pounds and with the most perfect cheeks I have ever seen.

The first few days have been a bit of a glorious blur: I think fatherhood is one of those rare things uncapturable by prose. What I can say with confidence and poise is this: Lucy is adorable and healthy; Haley is strong beyond belief, and recovering well; I am the luckiest and happiest man alive, and the three of us are blessed to have not just each other but a family of uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, and friends far and wide.

This could have been a much better show (and I suspect that the British show which inspired it very well might be), as I love the premise — half whodunit, half improv — but it is simply just not a good time to interact with. Feels like a series of ten-minute long webisodes with as many hits as misses.

At the very least, you can tell that the people involved are having a very good time. That's better than nothing!

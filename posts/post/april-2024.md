Welcome to spring, bona fide and humid. Lots of writing this month:

- [I wrote about spending the past two years as an independent technologist](https://jmduke.com/posts/essays/two-years/).
- On the media side of things: brief words on [Murderville](https://jmduke.com/media/murderville/) (meh), [The Parallax View](https://jmduke.com/media/the-parallax-view/) (incredible), [This is Personal](https://jmduke.com/media/this-is-personal/) (meh), [Cribsheet](https://jmduke.com/media/cribsheet/) (solid!).
- Lots of postging: [on friction logs](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/frictionlogmaxxing/), on [AI hype](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/frictionlogmaxxing/), on [Stripe Sessions '24](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/sessions-2024/), on [career growth](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/produce-value/), on [Seattle](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/seattle-forever/), on [closed-source](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/why-buttondown-isnt-oss/).

In other, non-writing news:

- We [launched Buttondown's new docs](https://docs.buttondown.com/introduction), the third iteration in eight years (the first being Notion, the second being what this new iteration is replacing.) This was largely Ben's project, and he's publishing a blog post more formally today or tomorrow on it; I'm really happy with how it turned out.
- Went to MicroConf. Still need to write up some notes; I had a great time.
- Busy, busy, busy. The next four months are gonna fly by.

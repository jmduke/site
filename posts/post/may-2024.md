And some media notes (it was a rare month where I basically only had positive things to say!):

- [Unreasonable Hospitality](https://jmduke.com/media/unreasonable-hospitality/)
- [Ripley](https://jmduke.com/media/ripley/)
- [Sugar](https://jmduke.com/media/sugar/)
- [The Club Dumas](https://jmduke.com/media/the%20club%20dumas/)
- [Everybody's in L.A.](https://jmduke.com/media/everybodys-in-la/)

In other, more-exciting, non-writing news:

- [My wife and I are expecting!](https://x.com/jmduke/status/1790037973540512226) The next four months are going to be a bit of a foot-on-the-gas-goblin-mode-slash-monk-mode extravaganza as I work to get Buttondown in as great of a place as it can be before I take an extended paternity leave.
- [I released my first new project in a while, under the auspecies of Buttondown](https://www.shovel.report/) â€” shovel.report, a sort of "`dig` on steroids" tool that's been really helpful with onboarding new customers.
- Buttondown's new summer intern Turki has been absolutely crushing it shipping a lot of great improvements to the Tiptap editor, including [our first (of likely many) Tiptap extension](https://github.com/buttondown/tiptap-footnotes).

Hello, 2025! (As always, [Death Cab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgHGFuPNus) remains the soundtrack by which you should read this.)

Headlining this month was [my annual review](/posts/post/2024/); everything else is flotsam.

But, speaking of flotsam:

- [A quick development note on the `order` attribute in CSS](/posts/post/order-css-tailwind/)
- Notes on [Linear](/posts/post/linear/) and [Fathom](/posts/post/fathom/)
- [Why Buttondown has an 'alternatives' page](/posts/post/the-alternatives-page/)
- Some thoughts on a [nascent new newsletter project](/posts/post/hypermodern-django/)
- [Letters to a young bartender](/posts/post/young-bartender/)
- A warning about [hidden settings](/posts/post/hidden-settings/)
- Only two pieces of media that I finished: [Case Histories](/posts/post/case-histories/) (meh) and [Luck be a Landlord](/posts/post/luck-be-a-landlord/) (much better)

I have much to write; the backlog is longer than ever before, both literally and figuratively. Our water is out; our daughter is happy; we are keeping sane, and warm, and busy, and we are sleeping lightly but well.

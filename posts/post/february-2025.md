What a start to the year! January was a bit more flat-packed than I think Haley and I would have otherwise liked, but all with great things. (Highlights include: first weekend trip with Lucy, signing a lease on an office, and Third South's annual offsite.)

A roundup of writing from the past month:

- [A quick note on nominative determinism, and where Buttondown got its name](/posts/post/whats-a-name)
- Lots of media reviews: [[Catch Me If You Can]], [[Book of Clouds]], [[Becoming Trader Joe]] (!), [[We Own This City]], [[Bringing up Bebe]], [[Planes, Trains, and Automobiles]],
- [A small snippet on truncating timedeltas in the Django ORM](/posts/post/django-extract-epoch)

Not as much fun writing in January than I had in the past few months; I promise my backlog of topics is longer than ever before.

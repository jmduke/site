Not a lot to share this month; it was a particularly busy time, between a mystery (and now solved, without fanfare or closure) cough and a dearth of time to write as I started to explore easing back into full-time work.

Still, some writing (and selfishly, I'm excited to end the year such that five essays is considered a "low" number for a month):

- Some thoughts on the industry: [[Shipping is capturing value]], [[VC does not guarantee PMF]], [[Klarna: nineteen years, twenty billion kroner]]
- Some press (and navelgazing): [[A good H1]], [[Applied Cartography Ã— Val Town]]
- Media notes on [[The MANIAC]]

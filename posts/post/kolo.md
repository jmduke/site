I had bookmarked [Kolo](https://kolo.app/) many months ago to try out and finally got a chance to integrate it with Buttondown — a process that I expected to take a couple hours on a lazy Sunday and in fact took ten minutes and three lines of code.

If you have a Django app, I think you should drop everything you're doing and install it right now. It is tremendously, _immediately_, terrific in a way that I haven't felt about a dev tool in quite some time: modern, ergonomic, immediately valuable, trivial to set up.

So much of my feeling on Django and the Python ecosystem writ large has felt [Squidward-esque](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/squidward-looking-out-the-window) — feeling comfortable with my architectural decisions and comfort with the language while watching Rails, Typescript, and even the PHP ecosystem advance their respective tech trees much more rapidly. This is a rare case where I am _delighted_ to have chosen Python, though I suspect it is only a matter of time until this tool (or at least this genre of tool) is language-agnostic.

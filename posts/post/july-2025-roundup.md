Telemachus turned five, two weeks ago. He did not have a great July; Richmond's been roiled by storms (ten nights in the past two weeks have ended with him hiding in the bathroom before bravely emerging at two in the morning, having wisely assessed that the threat has passed); add to that the fireworks on the fourth and the fireworks from the Flying Squirrels games the corgi blood pressure is high.

Despite this, he soldiers on: yesterday morning, just like every other morning, he woke up right as I did, patiently waiting thirty seconds for me to put on slippers and quietly tiptoe downstairs to feed him and put on the Moccamaster. He stood guard as I padded around the house in the early morning light; when Lucy woke up, ten minutes later, he was the first one in the nursery, snout pressed against the crib, checking in to make sure the situation was under control. And now, like every other evening, he's asleep not at but _on_ my feet as I write this, having worked a double shift and knowing by that his work is done by the sound of Lucy's (happy, raucous) splashes in the bath upstairs.

Tomorrow will be more of the same; he is a creature of routine and I am as well. August will be fun and busy: we're going to Antibes for a wedding (Lucy's first European soujourn!) and as excited as I am to showcase my truly awful command of French and subsist on a diet entirely of pastis and pissaladi√®re, it will be hard to extinguish the sight and thought of him glued to the front door, stoic and patient, guarding his home until his family returns.

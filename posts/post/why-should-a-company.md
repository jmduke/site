For a long time, my goal with Buttondown was largely around failure avoidance: "I want to get my first paying customer so I know it's not a fake product"; "I want to hit a thousand dollars in revenue so I know it's not just friends humoring me"; "I want to make $10K/mo or else I won't be able to work on it full-time if I want to"; and so on. It's now at the point where those kinds of milestones don't really exist: it's profitable enough to support my salary and the salary of others, it grows every month.

As such, I've become more attuned to what my goal really _should be_ with Buttondown. Most tech companies have a goal centered around some flavor of maximalism: disrupting an industry, revolutionizing a process, that kind of thing. Buttondown is not that kind of product; I am not that kind of person.

And yet I _do_ want Buttondown to grow larger than it currently is: not by leaps and bounds, of course, but there are things that I think _make it a better product_ that require further investment [^1] and I genuinely think there are a lot of people out there who would be happier using Buttondown than using their current tool. Both of those things imply a size of company that is _larger_ than Buttondown's current size. (I'm also having a lot of conversations with folks considering striking out on their own who are doing this brand of soul-searching, and realizing that their goals — "leave my nine-to-five and do whatever I want" are no longer my own.)

Right now, I think the answer for all of this is something like the following: **I want Buttondown to grow and flourish specifically to validate and proselytize a slightly different model of software company: one that uses all the amazing things about software (negligible marginal costs! the infinite breadth of the internet!) to build high-value, sustainable tools for customers and doing so in a way that is fair and rewarding to employees.** It seems almost trivializing to write that, but it's legitimately true. I think the world would be a better place if there were more smaller, older software companies focused on craftsmanship, and I think the best way to help catalyze that world is by building such a company.

My friend [Nick](https://twitter.com/nickbaum/status/1774218520693530965?t=M_YJHCkPF0gWKK16v7jjYg) pithily summed up his approach:

> Our philosophy:
>
> 1. Sustainable business
> 2. Sustainable team (high quality of life)
> 3. Without compromising those two, grow our positive impact on people

[^1]: In the figurative sense, not the literal one — I promise this is not a backdoor announcement of a Series A.

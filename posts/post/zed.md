I was late to the VS Code zeitgeist, and as penitence I try to go out of my way to try new editors whenever I see them â€” which is why this morning I installed [Zed](https://zed.dev/), which makes its bones on performance (yay!) and teams functionality (irrelevant for my use cases, but seems abstractly fertile.)

First: it is _quite_ fast, and feels good in many of the ways VS Code does not as a first-run experience. I like almost all of the choices they made (having spent a few hours working in it), and going back to VS Code feels _worse_ to the extent that interface lags and rough edges to which I was previously inured feel newly painful.

That being said: I am going back to VS Code, because too many things that to me are deeply important to my normal day-to-day engineering workflow (integrated test runner; [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens); [Kolo](/posts/post/kolo/)) do not have parity in Zed. But if/when they do, I'll be back.

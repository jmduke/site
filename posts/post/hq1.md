After many wonderful years of working out of my home office (see [[Workspaces]]), I've now "expanded" [^1] into an office of my own. 406 W Franklin St #201 is now the Richmond-area headquarters of Buttondown. Send me gifts!

The move is a bittersweet one; it was a great joy to be so close to Haley and Lucy (and, of course, Telly), and the flexibility of being able to hop off a call and then take the dog for a walk or hold Lucy for a while was very, very nice.

At the same time, for the first time in my life that flexibility has become a little bit of a burden! It turns out it is very hard to concentrate on responding to emails when your alternative is to play with your daughter giggling in the adjoining room; similarly, as Buttondown grows and as more and more of my time is spent on calls, it turns out long-winded demos and onboarding calls are logistically trickier when it is Nap Time a scant six feet away. And, beyond that, it's felt harder and harder to turn my brain off for the day: when there is always more work to be done, it's hard not to poke away at a stubborn pull request or jot down some strategy notes instead of being more present for my family (or even for myself, in a non-work capacity.)

So, I leased an office. The space is pretty cool: it's downtown in the sweet spot of a little more than a mile away from the house: trivially walkable (or bikeable, as the above photo suggests) but far enough away to give me a good bit of mental space. The building is an old manor (turned dormitory, turned office building). I've got a bay window with plenty of light but no views; I've got a nice ethernet connection and a Mac Mini with very few things installed; I've got a big Ikea desk and a printer; I've got an alarm on my phone for 4:50pm, informing me that it's time to go home, where my world becomes once again lively and lovely, full of noise and joy and laughter.

[^1]: Air quote because I'm fairly confident this office is actually _smaller_ than the home office.

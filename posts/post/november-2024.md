Hello! Lots of writing in October (what early parenthood takes away in terms of deep flow, it gives back in terms of twenty-minute pockets of time and thought):

- On the content front, I wrote about [[Monster Sanctuary]] (a delightful JRPG), [[The Anderson Tapes]] (a solid late-period Sean Connery heist), [[Trust]] (a rare postmodern novel that I disliked), [[Wolfs]] (meh, even with Pitt & Clooney to keep the thing afloat), and [[Slow Horses (Season 4)]] (a return to form!).
- I jotted down some notes on [[Meta's two assets]], [Zed](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/zed-2/), and [[Migrating to Django 5]].
- Opined a bit on productivity in [[My approach to GTD and PKM]] and [[Projects are things with steps]].
- I let my mind with [[You should build this:]], [[Notebook as marketing primitive]] and [[Consider the data product]].
- I argued that [[Talking to customers]] is overrated.
- I thought led on [Indie Rails](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/indie-rails/) and [People & Blogs](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/people-and-blogs/).
- Most importantly, I checked in on [two weeks of parenthood](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/two-weeks-of-parenthood/).

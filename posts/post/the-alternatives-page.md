Some kind words from [Chris Krycho on Buttondown's Alternatives page](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/buttondown-alternatives-page/):

> This is how I want all my tools to be. There is a ton of room in these markets for healthy and friendly competition — and no need at all for winner-take-all or monopolist attitudes.

First off — credit where it's due, I originally came across this genre of page [on Memberful's site](https://memberful.com/alternatives/), and my reaction was pretty much the exact same as Chris's.

Two other points I'd make in favor of this page, or at least something spiritually akin to it:

1. All of Buttondown's product missteps [^1] come from feedback from well-meaning, pleasant customers who deep-down are interested in a different product entirely. Being quite vocal about knowing _who we're building for_ is a good reinforcement mechanism to make sure the customer feedback we get (both implicit and explicit) is coming from the right people, and not someone really enthusiastic about our brand + ethos but is really just looking for a CMS.
2. People have loud mouths and long memories, especially in long-term, infrastructural spaces like e-mail. My second-largest-customer by LTV was referred by someone who trialed and liked Buttondown and ended up going with a different product because we didn't have omni-channel; we have many customers who don't use us for their first company and then switch to us for their second company; my personal favorite anecdote is screenshotted below, where a customer who tried Buttondown shortly after launch (who I then referred to a different product that had better pricing at the time) came back _six years later_.

This applies more to companies as described in [[Befriending the Goon Squad]], where your main goal is continued survival rather than winning a time-sensitive land-grab (or, if you're _really_ early on in your product's life, it can be useful to yes-and every single customer request to random-walk your way to PMF — but neither of these options are things that I would personally do myself nor recommend to others.)

[^1]: of which there are thankfully fairly few, but that's a separate essay for a different day.

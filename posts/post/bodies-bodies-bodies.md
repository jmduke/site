More than anything else, _Bodies Bodies Bodies_ is a perfectly reasonable and delightful way to spend 90 minutes. It is beautiful, well-acted, and consistently funny, with a banger soundtrack and a propulsive pace. Much like [[Glass Onion]], I think a lot of the attempts at social commentary work better if you treat them as being in service of broad comedy rather than any meaningful point; this is not a horror or a satire so much as a comedy film in the vein of [[Game Night]] or [[Do Revenge]], where half the fun is trying to keep up with how seriously you should take it. (For a film obsessed with youth, it reads so obviously written by someone who thinks they understand The Youths better than they do; the great one-liners salvage dialogue that is otherwise mired in someone reading Tumblr for research.)

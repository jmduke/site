Deeply fun and _aesthetic_ in a way that made it more satisfying and interesting than [[brotato]] (which I think a little too-quickly wore out its welcome.) There's a lot of luck in getting a good loadout relative to the true kings of the form (looking at you, [[Slay the Spire]]) but the only reason I'm considering this 'done' is because I'm sure there's more content ahead and I don't want to burn myself out while there's more yet to come.
